#Calcutta Socket

A Socket.io app built on Express.js that allows for real time management of Auctions. The socket allows users to create new or join exisiting pools and place/see what is up for bid, who has the winning bid, and what the value of the winning bid is.

## Installation
Fork or clone the repo and run `npm install` you will probably also want a daemon program like nodemon to continue to run the server during testing.

You'll need to set the Port on the index.js file

## Future Plans
* Expand functionality for full chats - right now only supports bidding
